        <h1>About Us</h1>
        <p>This project builds on a previously created database about Black musicians. It takes existing data and makes it accessible
            to others while also being available to add onto. The database contains information about album names, song titles, artist names,
            and artist birthdates. Having all of this information in one location makes it easier for individuals to learn about the history
            of Black artists when it can often be difficult to come by that information.
